# Sentiment-Analysis-With-BERT

This is a step-by-step notebook of how to implement pre-trained model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to preform sentiment analysis. We will use this model to analyze restaurant reviews and visualize the results of reviews from Bouchon Bakery in Las Vegas, NV. This is a modified dataset sourced from Kaggle titled “Yelp Restaurant Reviews” by Faruk Alam (April 2022).
